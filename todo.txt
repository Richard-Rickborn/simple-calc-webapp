Task listings will be structured like this

"[priority] [time investment/difficulty] -task"


priority will be graded from 1 - 5, with 1 being the highest priority:
	[1**]:  Critical task, do this as soon as possible
	[2*]:	Absolutely must be done, but not very immediate or time-sensitive
	[3]:	You don't need to do this yet, but you can see it looming on the horizon
	[4]:	Eh, look into it at some point
	[5]:	No rush on this, save it for a rainy day when you don't know what else to do

time investment/difficulty will be graded on a pretty loose scale of light, medium, and hard.
	Light:  Easy and/or requiring little time, for example any kind of one-line bug fix, or adding a simple CSS hover effect to a specific element.  Light tasks are expected to take up to one pomodoro, no longer.
	
	Medium:  A pretty average task, might take a couple pomodoros but it's doable and I know how I'm going to do it, for example (with my current knowledge), a medium task might be implementing a mergesort (would have to take a few minutes to remind myself how mergesort works but I know it's not super hard) or using console.log to track down the source of some unintended side-effect.
	
	Hard:  A difficult task that either I know will be extremely time consuming, or a task that I don't even know where to start with.  With where I'm at right now in my knowledge, a hard task would be, for example, setting up a basic server with Node.js (no idea how to do that, would have to sink time into tutorials and reading docs), or rewriting/refactoring large sections of an existing codebase (I know how to do it, but it's certain to take a lot of time).
