Task listings will be structured like this

"[priority] [time investment/difficulty] -task"


priority will be graded from 1 - 5, with 1 being the highest priority:
	[1**]:  Critical task, do this as soon as possible
	[2*]:	Absolutely must be done, but not very immediate or time-sensitive
	[3]:	You don't need to do this yet, but you can see it looming on the horizon
	[4]:	Eh, look into it at some point
	[5]:	No rush on this, save it for a rainy day when you don't know what else to do

time investment/difficulty will be graded on a pretty loose scale of light, medium, and hard.
	Light:  Easy and/or requiring little time, for example any kind of one-line bug fix, or adding a simple CSS hover effect to a specific element.  Light tasks are expected to take up to one pomodoro, no longer.
	
	Medium:  A pretty average task, might take a couple pomodoros but it's doable and I know how I'm going to do it, for example (with my current knowledge), a medium task might be implementing a mergesort (would have to take a few minutes to remind myself how mergesort works but I know it's not super hard) or using console.log to track down the source of some unintended side-effect.
	
	Hard:  A difficult task that either I know will be extremely time consuming, or a task that I don't even know where to start with.  With where I'm at right now in my knowledge, a hard task would be, for example, setting up a basic server with Node.js (no idea how to do that, would have to sink time into tutorials and reading docs), or rewriting/refactoring large sections of an existing codebase (I know how to do it, but it's certain to take a lot of time).

-[2*] [H] Mobile design needs tweaking, set up that remote mobile development thing you read about and try out some different font sizes

-[1**] [M] Add an "error display" display box on the left side of the display to show any kind of error status.  The "Err" from bad currentNumber values can be shown there, and when the DISPLAY_LIMIT is reached I can show some kind of error message there as well.

-[2*] [M] Decide on a (soft) completion point for this project, to avoid just iterating on this one project forever instead of moving on to the next great thing
	-Next time you get a chance, just spend a pomodoro making sure there's no more necessary tasks left besides what's on this list, and use any leftover time to plan next moves
-[3] [M] Readme is setup, but stlying for the readme is not quite working, take some time to learn how github markdown styling actually works and pretty up the readme
-[4] [H] Look at some other calc webapps for inspiration
