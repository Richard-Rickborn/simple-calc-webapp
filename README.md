<h5>What is this?</h5>
This is a calculator web application built using (vanilla, no framworks) HTML/CSS/Javascript.
<br />
This app is my first serious web development project.  The purpose of this app is to show where my frontend development skills are at the beginning of my web development learning process.  This application is the culmination of one month of HTML/CSS/Javascript learning, as well as the couple of weeks that it's taken to put the project together.
<br />
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a basic understanding of frontend development principles.  This project is also intended to be used as a benchmark of sorts; when I have more experience with web development, this early project can be compared to my later projects to see how my skills have grown.
